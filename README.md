## Graceful Degradation and Service Workers

Answer: Graceful degredation refers to when a web application continues to operate with less functionality when new technologies are not available. In this approach, service workers help to enable this by intercepting network requests and providing cached content when the user is offline. As a result, this makes the web application more usable by providing a dependable experience even when the user is offline even if it does not fully support all features.
